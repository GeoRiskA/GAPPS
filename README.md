<i>Prepare your scanned aerial photographs for photogrammetric procressing!</i>
</h3>

<br>

**GAPPS is a set of tools to prepare scanned aerial photographs for photogrammetric processing. It allows strandardizing the size/resolution of the photographs, as well as orienting them to get the centre of perspective of the photos at the centre of the digital image.**  

**GAPPS offers 5 main tools:**  
- **1. Canvas sizing:**  This first tool makes sure that all the scanned images have the same dimensions, by adding pixel rows or columns if needed.  
- **2. Fiducial mark detection:** This group of tools is used to automatically or manually detect the fiducial marks on the sides of the photographs.  
- **3. Reprojection:** This tool exploits the position of the fiducial marks to reproject and crop the images, to get images devoid of black margins, with their centre corresponding to the centre of perspective.  
- **4. Resize:** This tool downsamples and sharpens the reprojected images, for better photogrammetric results.  
- **5. Mask creation:** This tool creates a mask image that will hide the fiducial marks visible within the images during the photogrammetric processing.
